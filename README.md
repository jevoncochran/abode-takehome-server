# Backend Overview

The backend of this project is built on a Node.js/Express application using Typescript, providing a robust and scalable foundation for handling data and API requests. Database interactions, including queries, migrations, and seeds, are seamlessly managed by Knex. In the development environment, the backend utilizes SQLITE3, but it's designed to effortlessly transition to a more robust database like PostgreSQL for production.

## Backend Architecture

The backend architecture revolves around three main entities: users, events, and invites. Each entity is meticulously organized with corresponding migrations and seeds to ensure a structured and maintainable codebase.

### API Structure

The API is logically organized into four distinct levels, following a hierarchical order:

1. **Routers:** Define the routes for each entity (users, events, invites).
2. **Controllers:** Handle the incoming requests and delegate responsibilities to the appropriate services.
3. **Services:** Contain the business logic for each entity, ensuring separation of concerns.
4. **Models:** Represent the database interactions for users, events, and invites.

## Authentication

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing a secure and efficient method for managing user sessions and securing API endpoints.

This backend architecture is designed for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

# Future Improvements (Backend)

While the current backend provides a solid foundation for the project's functionality, there are several areas that could be enhanced for future releases. Consider the following improvements and features:

1. **Optimized Database Queries:**
   Fine-tune and optimize database queries to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage, especially as the scale of the application and the dataset grows.

2. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   Implement a robust logging and monitoring system to track application performance, detect issues, and facilitate debugging.

3. **Integration Testing:**
   Develop a comprehensive suite of integration tests to ensure the seamless interaction of various backend components and catch potential issues early in the development process.

4. **Caching Mechanisms:**
   Introduce caching mechanisms to optimize the response time of frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database.

5. **Extended Entity Relationships:**
   Explore and implement relationships between entities to add depth and complexity to the data model, accommodating evolving requirements.

6. **Automated Documentation:**
    Implement automated documentation tools (e.g., Swagger) to generate comprehensive API documentation, aiding developers and users in understanding and interacting with the API.

7. **Email Alert Optimization:**
   Evaluate and explore alternative methods for handling email alerts, considering more optimal solutions than the current cron job approach. Investigate event-driven architectures or scheduling mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of upcoming event scans for email alerts.
